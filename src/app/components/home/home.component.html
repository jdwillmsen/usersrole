    <p>Welcome to the Users Role project!</p>
    <p>This is an Angular Frontend Application with role base users. It uses firebase for the user authentication and
        it's assisted by Firebase functions with an Express server for the role authorization.</p>
    <p>There are 3 primary routes once authenticated:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a mat-button routerLink="/home">/home</a></li>
        <ul>
            <li>This is the home link and is currently being displayed.</li>
            <li>This page is not restricted to any logged in user.</li>
        </ul>
        <li><a mat-button routerLink="/profile">/profile</a></li>
        <ul>
            <li>This is a profile page for viewing information about the logged in user.</li>
            <li>This page is restricted to users with the user role.</li>
        </ul>
        <li><a mat-button routerLink="/users">/users</a></li>
